# Research Intersts

My research focuses on occurence and fate of first generation of neonicotinoids (i.e. classical neoncotinoids) and  fipronil insecticides in environs. My main research focuses include:

- Fate in surface water systems.
- Fate in groundwater systesm.
- Transport processes via surface runoff and groundwater infiltration.
- Fate and removal by conventional and advanced drinking water treatment plants. 
- Occurence, fate, and removal by activated sludge and membrane bioreactor-equipped (MBR) waste water treatment plants.
- Occurrence, fate, and degradation by industrial and residential-scale composting operations.

## What are Neonicotinoids?

Neoniotinoids are a suite of systemic pesticides first derived from nicotine in the early 1990's and are now one of the most frequently-applied pesticides in the world! If you've eaten produce or food produced using grain in the last 30 years, then chances are you've eaten something containing neonicinoids!
