# Welcome! 

Welcome to my personal research page! Here you can find my most recent work, presentations, awards, and publications from the Arnold Lab Group!

# A Special Thank You

Before we get into it, I would like to thank all of my undergradate lab assistants without whom this resaerch would not be possible. Sylvia, Sydney, Joe, Tim, and Nam have been critical to preparing and processing the hundreds of water samples we get each year. Without them, I never would have gotten this far on my research.

I would also like to thank the Arnold lab group. This amazing group of individuals have been the keystone of my sanity navigating gradschool in the middle of a globoal pandemic and the counless "upresidented times" we've faced the last two years. Their support, advice, and friendship has meant the world to me and I would not have made it this far without them.

# Research Intersts

My research focuses on occurence and fate of first generation of neonicotinoids (i.e. classical neoncotinoids) and  fipronil insecticides in environs. My main research focuses include:

- Fate in surface water systems.
- Fate in groundwater systesm.
- Transport processes via surface runoff and groundwater infiltration.
- Fate and removal by conventional and advanced drinking water treatment plants. 
- Occurence, fate, and removal by activated sludge and membrane bioreactor-equipped (MBR) waste water treatment plants.
- Occurrence, fate, and degradation by industrial and residential-scale composting operations.

## What are Neonicotinoids?

"Neo" meaning "new" and nicotinoids meaning "Nicotine-Like":
Neoniotinoids are a suite of systemic pesticides first derived from nicotine in the early 1990's and are now one of the most frequently-applied pesticides in the world! If you've eaten produce or food produced using grain in the last 30 years, then chances are you've eaten something containing neonicinoids!

Reaching over 250,000 pounds of pure product sold in Minnesota alone in 2019, neonicotinoids are by-far the most popular pesticide used in Minnesota agriculture. T

## What is fipronil?
