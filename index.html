<h1><a>About Me</a></h1>
<hr><hr><br>
Hello! I'm a doctoral candidate with the Arnold Research laboratory at the University of Minnesota Department of Civil, Environmental and Geo Engineering (anticipated graduation: June 2023) and a certified EIT in the states of Minnesota and Texas. Originally from Texas, I studied Environmental Engineering at Texas Tech University where I received my Masters and Bachelors of Science in Environmental Engineering at Texas Tech University. Following completion of my masters degree I joined the University of Minnesota continue my work in environmental chemistry in the Arnold Laboratory.  My current area of interest, highlighted in the <a href="currentprojects.html">research interests</a> section, focuses on environmental fate and transport of two classes of agricultural products: <b><em>Neonicotinoids and Fipronil</em></b>. My research aims to identify the extent of neonicotinoid and fipronil presence in surface waters, groundwater, water/wastewater treatment plants, and in soil systems while tracking trends in degradation and removal through various treatment and remediation processes. 

<br><br>

Following my impeding graduation in June 2023 I hope to continue my work as an industry-focused postdoctoral scholar before going to work as a subject expert in hazardous waste site investigation and remediation.

<br><br>

As I continue through my research, I'll continue to build this website to ensure any knowledge gained on my journey is accessible to those who may be interested or curious in my work. Enjoy!

<h1><a>Research Interests</a></h1>

<hr><hr>

<br>
My research focuses on occurrence and fate of first generation of neonicotinoids (i.e. classical neonicotinoids) and fipronil in the environment. My research focus includes:

<br>
<div style="padding-left: 2vw">
<ul>
  <li>Fate in surface water systems.</li>
  <li>Fate in groundwater systems.</li>
  <li>Transport processes via surface runoff and groundwater infiltration.</li>
  <li>Fate and removal by conventional and advanced drinking water treatment plants. </li>
  <li>Occurrence, fate, and removal by activated sludge and membrane bio reactor-equipped (MBR) waste water treatment plants.</li>
  <li>Occurrence, fate, and degradation by industrial and residential-scale composting operations.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<br>
